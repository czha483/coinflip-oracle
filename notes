=== Contract Improvements:


=== Web frontend improvements:
- keep record of bets, showing in table.
columns: query id, bet status (submitting, submitted, resolved), stake and payout.
- currently it is only for player.
later also support owner mode, for owner to deposit to the contract and withdraw from the contract.
